## Abstract

Loan officer at any bank would be interested in detecting the factors which can identify people who are likely to default on loans, consequently good and bad credit risks. Moreover, he will also be interested in designing model which can predict chances of default with reasonable accuracy. A crucial step in the loan application process is financial risk assessment, which helps financial institutions minimize credit risk and allocate resources as efficiently as possible. This paper creates a predictive framework for estimating the probability of loan defaults by combining factor analysis and logistic regression. While Factor Analysis lowers dimensionality and finds latent characteristics influencing financial risk, like credit history and debt-to-income ratio. Logistic Regression is a strong classification technique is used to estimate default probabilities by balancing sensitivity and specificity, the suggested model showed excellent predictive accuracy. It offers a data-driven and interpretable way to expedite loan approval decisions, guaranteeing a more fair and effective procedure.

## Introduction

The overall purpose of this project is to analyse and build a model on loan application data that can be useful for decision-making purposes. Traditional methods rely on credit scoring models that consider a range of financial and demographic variables. However, these models often face challenges due to multicollinearity, high dimensionality, and the lack of interpretability of complex relationships among variables. To address these limitations, advanced techniques of multivariate analysis are applied here: Factor Analysis & Logistic regression. These will help identify patterns, relationships, and predict from the dataset, thus supporting managerial decision making in risk assessment and loan approval processes. This term paper simulates the real-world scenario wherein a financial institution aims to optimize its loan approval system. The analysis would identify the key factors that influence loan decisions, segment customers into meaningful groups, and build predictive models for loan approval within the restrictions of risk management standards.

### objective 

a) To identify the key underlying factors that influence loan approval decisions
based on borrowers' financial profiles, credit history, and demographic characteristics.

b) To predict loan approval likelihood based on financial and demographic
factors, identifying significant predictors such as credit score, debt-to-income ratio,
homeownership, and loan term to inform loan decision-making.
